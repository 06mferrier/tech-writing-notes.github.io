I am working through the technical writing courses from Google. This document contains my notes and exercise solutions from the course and serves a couple of purposes:

* It provides me with notes that I can read at a later date,
* It gives me an exercise in using new tools, Specifically Asciidoc for writing the notes, and Antora for generating this site.

Use the navigation menu on the left hand side of the page to explore these notes. This is currently a work in progress, and more pages will be added as I write them up.
