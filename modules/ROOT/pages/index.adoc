== Introduction
I am working through the technical writing courses from Google. This document is my notes from the course and serves a couple of purposes:

* It provides me with notes that I can read at a later date,
* It gives me an exercise in using new tools, Specifically Asciidoc for writing the notes, and Antora for generating this site.

Use the navigation menu on the left hand side of the page to explore these notes.
